  abstract = {Does the life cycle of economic papers differ across fields of economic research? By constructing and analyzing a large dataset that combines information on 9,672 articles published in the top five economic journals from 1970 to 2000 with detailed yearly citation data obtained from Google Scholar, we find that published articles do have a life cycle that differs across fields of economic research (which we divide into the categories of applied, applied theory, econometric methods, and theory). Applied and applied theory papers are the clear winners in terms of citation counts. For the first years after their publication, they receive higher numbers of citations per year than papers in other fields of research do. They also reach a higher peak number of citations per year and apparently sustain those peak levels for longer, in addition to being cited over longer periods of time (i.e., they have a longer lifespan). Citation patterns are much less favorable for theoretical papers, which are the object of fewer citations per annum in the first years following publication, have lower peak numbers and a shorter lifespan. Econometric method papers are a special case; the pattern for most of these papers is similar to the pattern for theory papers, but the most successful papers (as measured by the number of citations) on econometric methods are also the most successful papers in the entire discipline of economics.

The changing field distribution of publications would not seem to favor empirical papers. But economics' empirical shift is a within-field phenomenon; even fields that traditionally emphasize theory have gotten more empirical. Empirical work has also come to be more cited than theoretical work. The citation shift is sharpened when citations are weighted by journal importance. Regression analyses of citations per paper show empirical publications reaching citation parity with theoretical publications around 2000. Within fields and journals, however, empirical work is now cited more.},

  abstract = {Does academic economic research produce material of general scientific value, or do academic economists write only for peers? Is economics scholarship uniquely insular? We address these questions by quantifying interactions between economics and other disciplines. Changes in the influence of economic scholarship are measured here by the frequency with which other disciplines cite papers in economics journals. We document a clear rise in the extramural influence of economic research, while also showing that economics is increasingly likely to reference other social sciences. A breakdown of extramural citations by economics fields shows broad field influence. Differentiating between theoretical and empirical papers classified using machine learning, we see that much of the rise in economics’ extramural influence reflects growth in citations to empirical work. This growth parallels an increase in the share of empirical cites within economics. At the same time, some disciplines that primarily cite economic theory have also recently increased citations of economics scholarship. ( JEL A11, A14)},

Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates whether specialisation in research is causing economics to become an increasingly fragmented and diverse discipline with a continually rising number of niche-based research programmes and a declining role for dominant cross-science research programmes. It opens by framing the issue in terms of centrifugal and centripetal forces operating on research in economics, and then distinguishes descriptive from normative pluralism. It reviews recent research regarding the JEL code and economics’ J. B. Clark Award that points towards rising specialisation and fragmentation of research in economics. It then reviews five related arguments that might explain increasing specialisation and fragmentation in economics: (i) Smith’s early division of labour view, (ii) Kuhn’s later thinking about the importance of specialisation, (iii) Heiner’s behavioral burden of knowledge argument, (iv) Ross’s innovation-diffusion analysis and Arthur’s theory of technological change as determinants of specialisation in science, and (v) the effects of space and culture or internationalisation on innovation appropriation. The paper then discusses what descriptive pluralism implies about normative pluralism, and makes a case for multidisciplinarity over interdisciplinarity as a basis for arguments promoting pluralism. The paper closes with brief comments on the issue of specialisation and pluralism in the wider world outside economics and science.},

We have organized the articles into three broad thematic areas. The first set of papers provides novel evidence on migrant selection. The following group of articles delves into the core literature of the labour market impacts of immigration, with a particular focus on high-skilled immigration and selective immigration policies. A final group of papers deals with more specific - and often controversial – topics: refugee migration, undocumented migration and the political consequences of migrant flows. In the concluding remarks, we extract from the different papers some guidance for future migration policies.},

Findings               There are significant discrepancies and often limited overlap between authors’ choices of JEL codes, editors’ choices as well as the choices by contemporary widely used AI systems. However, the observations suggest that generative AI can augment human intelligence in the micro-task of choosing the JEL codes and, thus, save researchers time.

Practical implications               AI systems may economize on classification costs and (semi-)automate the choice of JEL codes by recommending the most appropriate ones. Future studies may apply the presented approach to analyze whether the JEL code choices between authors, editors and AI systems converge and become more consistent as humans increasingly interact with AI systems.                                         Originality/value               We assume that the choice of JEL codes is a micro-task in which boundedly rational decision-makers rather satisfice than optimize. This exploratory experiment is among the first to compare human intelligence and generative AI in choosing and justifying the choice of optimal JEL codes.},

Co-authors that engage in a distant collaboration are significantly more likely to have a large research overlap, but this significance is lost when co-authors’ social networks are accounted for. High quality collaboration is more likely to emerge as a result of an interaction between specialists and generalists with overlapping fields of expertise. Regarding interactions across subfields of economics (interdisciplinarity), it is more likely conducted by co-authors who already have interdisciplinary portfolios, than by co-authors who are specialized or starred in different subfields.},

In this framework, we implement several popular algorithms for topical inference, including Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in a way that makes them completely independent of the training corpus size. Particular emphasis is placed on straightforward and intuitive framework design, so that modifications and extensions of the methods and/or their application by interested practitioners are effortless.

A community (also referred to as a module or a cluster) is typically thought of as a group of nodes with more connections amongst its members than between its members and the remainder of the network. Communities in networks also overlap as nodes belong to multiple clusters at once. Due to the difficulties in evaluating the detected communities and the lack of scalable algorithms, the task of overlapping community detection in large networks largely remains an open problem.In this paper we present BIGCLAM (Cluster Affiliation Model for Big Networks), an overlapping community detection method that scales to large networks of millions of nodes and edges. We build on a novel observation that overlaps between communities are densely connected. This is in sharp contrast with present community detection methods which implicitly assume that overlaps between communities are sparsely connected and thus cannot properly extract overlapping communities in networks. In this paper, we develop a model-based community detection algorithm that can detect densely overlapping, hierarchically nested as well as non-overlapping communities in massive networks. We evaluate our algorithm on 6 large social, collaboration and information networks with ground-truth community information. Experiments show state of the art performance both in terms of the quality of detected communities as well as in speed and scalability of our algorithm.},
